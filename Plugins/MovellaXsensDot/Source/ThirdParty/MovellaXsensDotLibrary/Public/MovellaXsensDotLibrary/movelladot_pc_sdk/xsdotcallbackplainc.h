	This structure contains pointers to functions that will be called by
	the Movella DOT PC SDK library when certain events occur. To use it
	in C, set any callback you do not wish to use to 0 and put a valid
	function pointer in the others. Then pass the object to the XsDotConnectionManager
	object's addXsDotCallbackHandler function.

	\note XsDotConnectionManager does not copy the structure contents and does not take
	ownership of it. So make sure it is allocated on the heap or at least
	removed from wherever it was added by calling removeXsDotCallbackHandler
	before it is destroyed.
